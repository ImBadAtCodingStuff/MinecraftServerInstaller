# MinecraftServerInstaller
Easily create a Minecraft server on your home pc

Install from the Releases section and dont install the .py files, unless you want to look at the code yourself

  This is just a fun project that I have been working on in my free time that I hope to keep working on in the future
  
  I am not the best python developer and do not know the most efficant way of coding things so if you see somthing dumb in the code its cuz im dumb lol
 
  If you have any ideas on how I could make it better let me know by messaging me on discord --backflop#7189--
  
  Because its a .exe file most web browsers will say its a malicious file and windows will stop you from downloading it, just click more info and run anyway to download it
  
  Also I am not that good with GitHub so if things dont make sense where they are placed in this project, sorry, I tried, lol
